## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background color: Dark, desaturated blue-gray (#292F36) to establish a premium and sophisticated feel, conducive to focus.
- Primary color: Subtle gold (#BFA169) as the primary color to create a premium feel while still providing visual interest and signaling importance in page elements; a color like gold stands out well against a darker background.
- Accent color: Slightly brighter, less saturated gold (#D4BA8A) to guide the user through the app; these will be especially important on UI elements the user will interact with often, like call-to-action buttons.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, as it is versatile enough to perform both roles and offers a clean, modern appearance.
- Use minimalist icons with subtle gold accents to maintain a premium aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout to enhance readability and user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.
